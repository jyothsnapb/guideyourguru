# GuideYourGuru

Welcome to GuideYourGuru, an experimental project aimed at bringing accountability to the higher education sector in India through the power of community.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a LinkedIn post I came across, detailing the traumatic experiences of a PhD student at the hands of his supervisor (I would be happy to include your name if you want to be identified here on this portal). I have witnessed several equally horrible incidents happening to many of my friends in academia due to the centralized power held by supervisors and institutions.

## Mission

So let's do what the internet does best - let's decentralize that power. Trauma often camouflages as academic rigor, and toxicity and abuse are frequently misattributed to students' lack of competence. This flawed system, intended to create holistically developed and healthy future citizens, instead produces individuals who 'simply want to escape' or 'perpetuate.'

## Objectives

1. **Expose and Address Toxicity**: Highlight and address toxic behaviors and environments within academia.
2. **Promote Accountability**: Encourage accountability among educators and institutions.
3. **Support Students**: Provide a platform for students to share their experiences and support each other.
4. **Encourage Systemic Change**: If there's enough momentum, work towards implementing systemic changes in the academic environment. I have some ideas, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on this one.

## How It Works

GuideYourGuru allows grad school students to review and rate their professors and institutions. By sharing honest feedback, we can collectively identify patterns of abuse and support positive change.

## Call to Action

Of course, not all academic experiences are negative. However, there seems to be an alarming number of cases to warrant this step. This project aims to explore and uncover these issues. If we find that the problem is widespread, we will have the data to advocate for systemic change.

Join me in this exploratory mission. Together, let's give some stakes to the people for whom this system is actually meant - the students.

Thank you for your support,
Jyothsna

## Disclaimer

I know that similar websites exist. This is for a demographic that's currently not served by them, my home country India. This is just a non-monetized single-person side project currently and, like I said, exploratory. I'd be happy to explore any collaborations as well. My aim is just to see if we can have some degree of resolution to a lot of peoples' grievances. Oh, also, I'll be starting with the domain that I'm most familiar with, STEM, and would be happy to expand in the future.
